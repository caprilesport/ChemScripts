"""
This function gets the energy and dipole of all the conformers in a log file
and compares the energy of all of them in order to find duplicates

Then, an .CSV file is created with all the nr of the structures, the energies and the 
dipole moments of each one

For all the unique conformers the boltzmann distribution is calculated and a file_boltzmann.csv is 
created with the distribution, energy and so forth and so on

It also generates a .xyz file with all the conformers the script found to be unique

==== examples ====

for the file molecule.log

julia> ChemScripts.getenergy("molecule.log")

A molecule.csv file will be created with all the conformers

A molecule_boltzmann.csv file will be created with the boltzmann distribution

A molecule.xyz file will be create with the structures of all the unique conformers
