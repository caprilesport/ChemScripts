function getenergy(inpfile)

    """

    This function gets the energy and dipole of all the conformers in a log file,
    and compares the energy of all of them in order to find duplicates

    Then, an .CSV file is created with all the structures, the energies and the 
    dipole moments of the structures

    It would be a good ideia to already (from the .log file) obtain the inputs that are needed 
    for the next calculations, this has to be done yet
